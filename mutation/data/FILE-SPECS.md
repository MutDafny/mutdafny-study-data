# Specifications of data files

## `generated/scan/data/<mutation operator, BOR|BBR|UOI|UOD|LVR|EVR|LSR|LBI|CIR|SDL>/<Benchmark name>/<Dafny program name>/data.csv`

File automatically generated by the [`../scripts/run-scan.sh`](../scripts/run-scan.sh) script.

- `benchmark_name`: Benchmark name
  * factor: DafnyBench

- `program_name`: Program name
  * factor, e.g., 630-dafny_tmp_tmpz2kokaiq_Solution

- `mutation_operator`: Acronym of the mutation operator
  * factor: BOR, BBR, UOI, UOD, LVR, EVR, LSR, LBI, MCR, CIR, or SDL

- `parsing_time`: time in milliseconds to parse the Dafny program
  * numerical, e.g., 1

- `plugin_time`: time in milliseconds to execute the plugin 
  * numerical, e.g., 3

- `resolution_time`: time in milliseconds to resolve the Dafny program
  * numerical, e.g., 7

- `verification_time`: time in milliseconds to verify the Dafny program
  * numerical, e.g., 9

- `number_of_targets`: number of mutation targets found in the program
  * numerical, e.g., 899

- `scan_time`: total time in milliseconds to run MutDafny's `scan` command
  * numerical, e.g., 7182

## `generated/scan/data/<mutation operator, BOR|BBR|UOI|UOD|LVR|EVR|LSR|LBI|CIR|SDL>/<Benchmark name>/<Dafny program name>/targets.csv`

File automatically generated by the [`../scripts/run-scan.sh`](../scripts/run-scan.sh) script.
The CSV file is headless but organized in three comma separated columns.

- First column represents the file's location to be mutated, which can be a single number or a range.
  * factor, e.g., 335, 200-420

- Second column represents the mutation operator.
  * factor: BOR, BBR, UOI, UOD, LVR, EVR, LSR, LBI, MCR, CIR, or SDL

- Third column represents an extra argument that may be necessary to identify the mutation to perform. (Note: the type of argument depends from operator to operator and, for some operators, may not even be necessary. This is explained in more detail in [MutDafny's main repository](https://github.com/MutDafny/mutdafny/blob/main/README.md))
  * factor, e.g., Ge
